    "It tracks the S&P 500 Index, composed of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal is to replicate the performance of the US large-cap stock market.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is characterized by presenting high volatility and growth potential, having historically provided (the stocks) the highest returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IEF (iShares 7-10 Year Treasyry Bond ETF)\n",
    "\n",
    "It tracks an index composed of US Treasry bonds with remaining maturities between 7 and 10 years. These are debt obligations issued by the US government.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to provide a steady stream of interest payments with lower volatility than stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics include a lower growth potential primarly from interest payments, lower risk/volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In times of stock market stress, investors often flock to US Treasuries, which can cause IEF to rise when IVV is falling.\n",

    "\n",
    "The price of gold bullion. Each share of GLD represents a fractional, undivided interest in the trust, which holds physical gold bars in a secure vault.\n",

    "Gold produces no income (like dividends or interest). Its return comes purely from price changes. It is seen as a store of value when a currency's purchasing power declines.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's price often moves independently of tocks and bonds. It can perform well during periods of geopolitical uncertainity, market stress, or loss of confidence in the financial system."
