A comprehensive quantitative financial analysis project analyzing ETF portfolios with Python, SQL, and Power BI.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project analyzes three major ETFs to understand their historical performance, risk characteristics, and diversification benefits:
- **IVV** (iShares Core S&P 500 ETF) - U.S. Large-Cap Stocks
- **IEF** (iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF) - U.S. Government Bonds
- **GLD** (SPDR Gold Shares) - Physical Gold

The analysis includes:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Returns calculation and visualization
- Statistical analysis and risk metrics
- Portfolio optimization insights
- Interactive Power BI dashboards (coming soon)

## Documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Run on GitHub (View Only)
Simply browse the notebooks in order on GitHub. The analysis is fully documented.

### Option 2: Run Locally (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/QuantFolioAnalysis.git
cd QuantFolioAnalysis
```
2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **Launch Jupyter:**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
4. **Run notebooks in order:**

Start with 01_data_collection.ipynb to understand data sourcing
Then run 02_eda_cleaning.ipynb for the analysis

## 📊 What's Included

### Notebook 1: Data Collection
- Downloads historical ETF data from Yahoo Finance (2005-2025)
- Uses yfinance library for reliable data fetching
- Saves data for reproducible analysis

### Notebook 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Price visualization: See how each ETF evolved over 20 years
- Returns calculation: Both simple and logarithmic returns
- Cumulative returns: Track growth of $1 investment
- Correlation analysis: Understand diversification benefits

### Notebook 3: Statistical Analysis (03_statistical_analysis.ipynb)
- Stationarity testing (ADF, KPSS tests)
- Normality testing (Jarque-Bera, Shapiro-Wilk)
- Volatility analysis with GARCH effects detection
- Autocorrelation analysis (returns, absolute returns, squared returns)
- Comprehensive risk metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, VaR, CVaR, Maximum Drawdown)

### Notebook 4: Portfolio Optimization (04_portfolio_optimization.ipynb)
- Modern Portfolio Theory implementation
- Efficient frontier visualization
- Optimal portfolios: Maximum Sharpe, Minimum Variance, Risk Parity
- Backtesting with $10,000 initial investment
- Performance comparison across market regimes

## Key Achivements

### ✅ Completed Analysis:
- 20-year historical analysis (2005-2025, ~5,200 trading days)
- Comprehensive statistical testing (ADF, KPSS, Jarque-Bera, Shapiro-Wilk)
- Advanced risk metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, CVaR, Maximum Drawdown, Omega Ratio)
- Volatility clustering and GARCH effects identification
- Correlation dynamics and diversification benefits analysis
- Modern Portfolio Theory implementation with efficient frontier
- Four optimized portfolios with backtesting results

### Key Findings:
- Non-Normal Distributions: All ETF returns reject normality (fat tails, skewness)
- Stationary Returns: Log returns are stationary (suitable for time series modeling)
- Volatility Clustering: GARCH effects present across all assets
- Diversification Benefits: Negative correlation between IVV and IEF during crises
- Optimal Allocation: Maximum Sharpe portfolio outperforms individual assets

## 🔮 Next Steps Planned

- SQL database integration for results storage and querying
- Power BI dashboard for interactive visualization
- Automated data pipeline for daily updates

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Data Source
- Provider: Yahoo Finance (free, reliable historical data)
- Frequency: Daily prices
- Adjustments: Auto-adjusted for splits and dividends
- Period: 2005-01-01 to 2025-10-01

### Key Calculations

- Simple Returns: $r_t = (P_t - P_{t-1}) / P_{t-1}$
- Logarithmic Returns: $\ln(P_t / P_{t-1})$
- Cumulative Returns: $(1 + r_1) \times (1 + r_2) \times ... \times (1 + r_n) - 1$
- Annualized Volatility: $\sigma_{\text{annual}} = \sigma_{\text{daily}} \times \sqrt{252}$
- Sharpe Ratio: $\frac{E[R] - R_f}{\sigma}$
- Maximum Drawdown: $\text{MDD} = \frac{\text{Trough} - \text{Peak}}{\text{Peak}}$
